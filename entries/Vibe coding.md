Vibe coding is an artificial intelligence-assisted software development style popularized by Andrej Karpathy in early 2025.[1] It describes a fast, improvisational, collaborative approach to creating software where the developer and a large language model (LLM) tuned for coding are acting rather like pair programmers in a conversational loop. Unlike traditional AI-assisted coding or prompt engineering, vibe coding emphasizes staying in a creative flow: the human developer avoids micromanaging the code, accepts AI-suggested completions liberally, and focuses more on iterative experimentation than code correctness or structure.

Karpathy described it as "fully giving in to the vibes, embracing exponentials, and forgetting that the code even exists." He used the method to build prototypes like MenuGen, letting LLMs generate all code, while he provided goals, examples, and feedback via natural language instructions.[2] The programmer shifts from manual coding to guiding, testing, and giving feedback about the AI-generated source code.[3][4][5]
